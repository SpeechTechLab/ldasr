# Layer Dropping in Automatic Speech Recognition
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper entitled "LDASR: An Experimental Study on Layer Drop using Conformer-based Architecture" accepted in EUSIPCO-2024 

# Summary
This work applies the Layer Drop (which itself is inspired from Stochastic Depth) technique to the Conformer based architecture having a 1-d convolutional feature extractor. We modified the Conformer module's architecture by adding a Gating unit that controls the input flow in conformer submodules.
